# My dot files

- Initially I just had dotfiles, no backup, no nothing.
- Then I backed everything up in my google drive, and created a scrit to symlink everything.
- Then I met https://github.com/carlhuda/janus and improved my vim.
- Then I met https://github.com/begriffs/haskell-vim-now and I love it, but I wanna learn
how to improve my vim to make it as nice as the one that it setups.
- Then watched https://upcase.com/videos/intro-to-dotfiles and finally decided to create my own public
dotfiles.
- Now need to improve the organization and just leave the things that I really use.
